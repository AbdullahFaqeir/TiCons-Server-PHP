#TiCons
Generate a ZIP with all Titanium [icons & splash screens](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/guide/Icons_and_Splash_Screens) from just 2 or 3 files.

## Website
Use TiCons online at: [http://ticons.fokkezb.nl/](http://ticons.fokkezb.nl/)

## Roadmap
I hope to extend TiCons with the following features:

* Generate HTML splash screen based on icon and background color.
* Automatically delete generated ZIP files after some time.
* Let the use select which platforms and formfactors to generate assets for.
* Provide a PSD containing guides for optimal cropping-pleasure.

Feel free to [mail](mail@fokkezb.nl) me or fork the code and send a pull-request.
